                        <p>While I don't have any formal work experience, I do have a few projects I've worked on!</p>
                        <p>Endless Rhythm, May 2024</p>
                        <p>A browser based, procedurally generated rhythm game based on games such as Osu! Mania and Piano Tiles.</p>
                        <p>The difficulty gradually scales, and you're also able to input custom patterns.</p>
                        <p>It's mostly intended as a practice tool, and does not contain actual music.</p>
                        <p>To try it out, click HERE!</p>
                        <p>Drowsy Driving Alarm, May 2023</p>
                        <p>During my senior year of High School, me and a group of 3 other friends worked together to build a drowsy driving alarm.</p>
                        <p>Drowsy driving accounts for ~10% of all road crashes, and causes similar effects to drunkenness.</p>
                        <p>Our device uses eye detection to send an alert when the driver's eyes are closed for an abnormaly large period of time.</p>
                        <p>The alert sounds an alarm, causes the headrest to vibrate, and calls an emergency contact.</p>
                        <p>To see it in action, click below!</p>

                        <p>Incremental Cookies, January 2022</p>
                        <p>Another browser game, where your goal is to bake as many cookies as possible.</p>
                        <p>It was inspired by other incremental games such as Cookie Clicker.</p>
                        <p>The game is short and unfinished, and it's one of the first web projects I ever worked on.</p>

                        <p>Here are some fun/interesting websites that I've found over my time on the internet!</p>
                        <p>Neocities</p>
                        <p>This website is actually a giant collection of personal websites, brimming with creativity and early 1990s-2000s vibes.</p>
                        <p>For me, it's easy to get lost for hours, clicking from website to website, and it can be really inspiring creatively looking at what other people have made.</p>
                        <p>Windows93</p>
                        <p>An operating system in your browser, packed with games, tools, and a lot of charm.</p>
                        <p>The games can be pretty fun, but they're mostly joke programs.</p>
                        <p>Neal.fun</p>
                        <p>A collection of games and other informative programs made by Neal.</p>
                        <p>My personal favorites include Infinite Craft, Spend Bill Gate's Money, The Password Game, Stimulation Clicker, and Internet Artifacts.</p>
                        <p>The Useless Web</p>
                        <p>A bunch of fun, random, and useless websites, all at the press of a button.</p>
                        <p>This is one of the earliest websites I remember showing my friends, and can be pretty fun to browse when bored.</p>
                        <p>Universal Paperclips</p>
                        <p>One of the earlist and most popular incremental games, where the goal is to make as many paperclips as possible.</p>
                        <p>An easy way to sink a few hours when bored in class.</p>
                        <p>Piskel</p>
                        <p>A free pixel art editor, allowing you to make art and animations in the website.</p>
                        <p>It's pretty fun to play around with, and anything you make can be exported and used elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>Vimm's Lair</p>
                        <p>This website has a ton of old console games, from the Atari 2600 all the way up to the Wii.</p>
                        <p>I mainly use this website to download old Pokemon games from the DS and Wii era.</p>
